There are three assumptions necessary for performing network tomography. The first one refers to existing a known routing matrix. This basically says that we must know all links between all nodes that contitute the network. As it is easy to see the anti-flooding mechanism proposed in the question would not influence in any aspect this assumption.

The next premisse for network tomography is the existence of link independence. This requires that loss rates on different links are independent. If a link has a determined loss rate this is completely inpendent event from another link having another packet loss rate. Altough on real networks this premiss is not completely true (links loss rate are not completely independent events), in order to perform network network tomography we have to do a relaxation of thisa reality and assume this assumption. When using the the proposed anti-flooding mechanism we notice that we can no longer maintain this property true.

Finally the last assumption relies on identical sampled rates through all nodes. The implementation of the proposed anti-flooding mechanism does not affect the pasling rate through the nodes in the network, therefore we can use network tomography to infer the loss rate of each link. anything the
